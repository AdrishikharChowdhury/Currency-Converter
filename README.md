## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

This is a front-end project and requires no special backend setup.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Open the `index.html` file in your browser.**
    -   For the best experience, it is recommended to use a live server extension (like "Live Server" in VS Code) to avoid potential CORS issues with API calls.

## üß† How It Works

The application operates based on a few key JavaScript functions:

1.  **Initialization**: On page load, the script populates the "from" and "to" currency dropdowns using the `countryList` object from `codes.js`. It also checks `localStorage` to apply a previously saved dark mode preference.
2.  **API Fetching**: When the user clicks the "Convert" button, an `async` function makes a `fetch` request to the Frankfurter API, requesting the latest rates for the selected base currency.
3.  **Calculation**: The script extracts the specific exchange rate for the target currency from the API response and calculates the converted amount.
4.  **DOM Manipulation**: The calculated result is then displayed in the output field. The country flags are updated whenever a new currency is selected in the dropdowns.
5.  **Theme Toggling**: The dark mode toggle adds or removes a `.dark-mode` class to the `<html>` or `<body>` element, and the corresponding styles are applied. The user's choice ("enabled" or "disabled") is saved in `localStorage`.
